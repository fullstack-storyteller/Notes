## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- An example is the Azure virtual machine service
- Here you don't need to manage the underlying infrastructure.
- The physical servers and storage is managed for you
- This helps remove the capital expense and reduces ongoing cost
- The virtual machine also has a very high SLA. To achieve that SLA for any on-premise server would require a lot of work.
- Infrastructure cloud services also allow you to scale on demand using Azure Virtual Machine Scaleset, that accomplishes that.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- An example is the Azure SQL Database or the Azure Web App service
- Here you don't have to manage the infrastructure or even the underlying operating system and platform components
- You can just start hosting your data or your web application
- Reduces development and deployment time.
- You can also use an array of database technologies available in the case of Azure
- All of these services are Pay-as-you-go model

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

- An example is Microsoft Office 365
- Here you don't need to manage the infrastructure or even the underlying operating system, platform components or even the software
- Here you just start directly using the software
- You can access your application data from anywhere.
- You don't have the headache of managing anyhting.
