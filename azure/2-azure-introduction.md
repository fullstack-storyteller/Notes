# Introduction to Azure

Azure provides a free account and as of June 16, 2021, it provide 25 free service, $200 for first 30 days, and some services are fre for 12 months. In azure free account their will be a lot of restrictions.

## Azure is available at

[Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

Make sure to at least create a free account using github or microsoft accounnt for working with Azure

## Resources and Resource Groups

- Resource:
  > Any Azure product that is being used to deliver some kind of computing need to the customer, is called a resource
- Resource groups:

  > Logicaly group your resources into groups or says a container to host resources, and is called resource group.
  > Benefit of grouping resources is that you can manage the resources on a hihger level, i.e. for example adding fine grained permission to a resource group instead on adding permission on a resource level. another example would be decommissioning a resource group rather than decommissioning individual resources.

## Azure Regions

Regions in Azure are geographical locations where the data or the computing hardware is actually kept.

Note: _*Government Azure regions locations will not be disclosed*_

## Azure Subscriptions

Every resource in Azure is associated with a particular Resource group and a particular subscription. It helps if we have different subscription for different departments in a company. Subsciption can be of many types:

1. Pay as you go
2. Developer Support
3. Professional Direct Support
4. Standard Support

(We will discuss more on this later)
