Data is all around us and companies like to collect data or use their existing data to improve upon their existing services and products. They can even use data to focus more of obtaining new customers and new assets. A well articulated way of storing analysizing data is needed to come to a result this complicated.

Example, for a Web application: the company may want to know which geography or demographic is using this web app and help design content and advertize more relevant product on their website.

A Typical Data Lake may look like:
WEB APP/MOBILE APP/SERVER LOGS -> DATA INGESTION LAYER -> PREPARAE AND TRAIN YOUR DATA -> DATA WAREHOUSE -> PERFORM ANALYTICS (using PowerBI)

Note: when working with SQL Data Warehouse, avoid inserting data one by one, but load data as a set.
