# Azure Virtual Machine Service

Before public cloud, a business had to have a physical server on premises and they that physical server used to have Virtual Machines hosted in those physical server using Hyper-V or VM-Ware tools. The business was responsible for the underlying maintenance and storage of the physical server.

In public cloud like Azure, the business doesn't have to worry about the physical server, they just need to take care of the virtual machines (VM). The underlying physical structure is completely managed by the Cloud Vendor.

### The Virtual Machine Service is known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

## Benefits of Azure Virtual machine Service

- No need to buy the physical server hence, less upfront investment
- Pay only for the running cost of the virtual server
- Terminate the virtual server at any time.
